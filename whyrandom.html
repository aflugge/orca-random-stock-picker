              <h5>Can I not do better than random?</h5>
	      <p>No, not really. If one could identify a strategy clearly better than random, then other people would use it &mdash; 
		the assets bought according to that strategy would rise in price until the strategy loses its advantage. 
		You are just as likely to underperform the market than to beat it.</p>
	      <h5>If I cannot beat the market, why not buy index funds?</h5>
	      <p>To be honest, if you just want to invest some money and don't think about it, then you are probably best of buying a cheap index fund with a low annual charge and forget about it.</p>
		<p>However, the theory behind random stock picking says, that picking random stocks is actually better than an index fund, because even if on average the markets values companies correctly 
		and you cannot tell which one is overvalued and which is undervalued, there will still be some overvalued and some undervalued stocks. As an index fund invest in companies weighted by market-value
		it systematically buys more shares of overvalued stocks and less shares of undervalued stocks and therefore systematically underperforms the market. Buying a small-caps fund doesn't solve that problem,
		because within the smaller companies a small-caps index fund again would be baised toward those companies that are relatively overvalued.</p>
		 <p>Also, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://orca.app/rBNUAD">Orca</a> does not charge you a fee just for holding stocks, 
		so picking your own stocks and holding them for the longer-term might well be cheaper than paying a annual charge to a fund manager.
		 You can also filter the random choices with your own preferences &mdash; don't like to invest in fossil fuels, just role the dice again and pick another stock.
		 Finally, if you are interested in the stock market, then buying individual stocks might be something you enjoy doing.</p>
